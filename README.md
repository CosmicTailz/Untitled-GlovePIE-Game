# Untitled GlovePIE Game

Yep, a whole playable game made entirely within GlovePIE!


## Running the game:

To play the game, you will need GlovePIE (at least version 0.43, any lower versions may not work correctly) and a PC with Windows XP or above. Windows 2000 may also work if you have it for whatever reason.

You can get GlovePIE here: https://github.com/Ravbug/GlovePIE

Double-click "Untitled GlovePIE Game.PIE", if a window appears asking how you'd like to open the file, scroll to the bottom and select "Look for another app on this PC". Navigate to GlovePIE.exe (or PIEFree.exe for versions later than 0.43) and select it to run the game through GlovePIE. In Windows 2000/XP/Vista, you may have to manually run GlovePIE as administrator for all of the features to work.

Don't open the game via an active GlovePIE window, or else the sounds and graphics won't load correctly or at all. Using a shortcut will work just fine.

Once GlovePIE is open, click the "Run" button near the top of the window to start the game.

Always make sure to close/stop the game before opening another window. All of the visuals are made via fake cursors which might cause interference with any programs running behind GlovePIE.


## How to play:

The goal of the game is to get through as many levels as possible and get a high score. Your current level is displayed at the top of the screen in the debug window while your score and health are at the bottom left of the playing space.

Use the arrow keys to move around, Z to jump, and X to shoot. Jumping over enemies and projectiles allows you to escape getting hurt when timed correctly, but you cannot shoot until you're back on the ground.

When there are no enemies left on the screen, you will advance to the next level and your health will be increased by 1 if it is below 5.


## Other stuff:

You can do pretty much whatever you want with the game, and you are allowed to distribute your own modified versions of the game as long as you link this GitHub repository somewhere with it. You cannot, however, redistribute the unmodified game or any of its assets.

Untitled GlovePIE Game is offered without any warranty whatsoever. Run the game at your own risk. It's highly unlikely that anything bad will happen to your computer by running it, but don't yell at me if something goes wrong.
